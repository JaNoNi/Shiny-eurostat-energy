## Portfolio examination Part 2 (Due date 15.01.2021)

This is my solution to the homework given in our course **Data Visualization and Visual Analytics**. This is my

inspiration comes from here: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/energy/visualisations.

All data used in this app has been taken from the [Eurostat Website](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/main/home) Â© European Union, 1995 - today.
